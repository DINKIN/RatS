This project serves for parsing your ratings from one movie tracking / rating website to another.

## How do I use this?
This project is currently under development and is not ready to use yet. Please be patient, as I'm only working on this every once in a while.

## Where does the name come from?
The name for this project comes from the first letters of "**rat**ing **s**ynchronisation". It's that simple.
